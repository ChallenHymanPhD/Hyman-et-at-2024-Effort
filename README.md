# Overview
This data repository contains all R code and data files used to recreate the analysis in *Modeling effort in a multispecies recreational fishery; influence of species-specific temporal closures, relative abundance, and seasonality on angler-trips*.
Data files can be found in [the Data-Files](https://github.com/ChallenHymanPhD/Hyman-et-at-2024-Effort/tree/Data-Files) branch, while R code can be found in the [the R-Files](https://github.com/ChallenHymanPhD/Hyman-et-at-2024-Effort/tree/R-files) branch. Each R script contains instructuctions for use the script to replicate figures and tables. R scripts are ordered by use in analysis. All files can be read directly into the scripts directly by the R code, but the user can also generate the CSV files and model results from each script as needed for replication and reproducibility.
